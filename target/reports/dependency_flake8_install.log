    DEPRECATION: Uninstalling a distutils installed project (entrypoints) has been deprecated and will be removed in a future version. This is due to the fact that uninstalling a distutils project will only partially uninstall the project.
You are using pip version 9.0.3, however version 19.0.3 is available.
You should consider upgrading via the 'pip install --upgrade pip' command.
